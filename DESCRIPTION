Description: This package provides tools for performing simulation studies and 
    variance partition coefficient (VPC) estimation for generalized linear mixed 
    models (GLMMs). It includes functions to compare VPC estimates across different 
    model families, such as negative binomial, tweedie, and gaussian, and supports 
    customizable simulation setups for evaluating model performance and bias in 
    complex data structures.
